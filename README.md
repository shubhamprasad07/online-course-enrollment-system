## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

* **`Project-BackEnd/`**: Contains the Spring Boot application, including controllers, services, repositories, entities, security configurations, and exception handling.
* **`Project-FrontEnd/`**: Houses the web-based user interface, including HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and Bootstrap assets.

## üí° Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
* **Maven 3.x**
* **A SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2 - configured in `application.properties`)**
* **Node.js & npm (optional, for frontend build tools if any)**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shubhamprasad07/online-course-enrollment-system.git](https://github.com/shubhamprasad07/online-course-enrollment-system.git)
    cd online-course-enrollment-system
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the `Project-BackEnd` directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project-BackEnd
    ```
    Configure your database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    Build the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate back to the root of the project and then into the `Project-FrontEnd` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../Project-FrontEnd
    ```
    Open the `login.html` (or your primary entry point HTML file) in your web browser. You might need to adjust the API endpoints in your JavaScript files to point to `http://localhost:8080` if you're running the backend locally.
